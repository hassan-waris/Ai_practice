This project explores how computer vision and machine learning can be applied to detect pneumonia at its earliest stages. By analysing medical images, the model can flag potential cases for further review. The project reflects my interest in the medical field and my goal of leveraging AI to help save lives.

Pneumonia data was used from Kaggle [Download Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
