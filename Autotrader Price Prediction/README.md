During my master’s, I developed a price prediction model for AutoTrader using their live dataset, as part of a project in partnership with MMU. The model leverages machine learning techniques to estimate vehicle prices based on multiple features. Please note that the dataset provided by AutoTrader cannot be shared, so it is not included in this repository.
