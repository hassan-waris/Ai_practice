For this project, I developed a prototype system that allows users to upload a PDF and ask questions about its content. The document is split into chunks, converted into embeddings using OpenAI’s embedding models, and stored in a FAISS index for similarity search. GPT-4-turbo is then used to generate answers based on the most relevant sections. This project was built to explore how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works and gain hands-on experience with the approach. I am currently developing a full, in-depth version with a complete front-end and back-end architecture.
