For this project, I developed a system designed to analyse human behaviour and identify factors that may lead to potential violence or harm. The system can be deployed in venues or events to monitor foot traffic, tracking how many people enter and leave, and help ensure the safety of workers and attendees. The project uses computer vision techniques, including YOLO for object detection, and leverages behavioural cloning and video analysis of human behaviour patterns. Data processing is handled with NumPy, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis to support proactive safety measures.
