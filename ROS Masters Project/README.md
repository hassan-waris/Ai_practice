For my master’s project, I designed an injury prevention robot aimed at environments that involve heavy lifting. The robot assists by carrying objects from one location to another, while monitoring workers’ posture to ensure they lift items with proper technique. The system leverages computer vision, ROS (Robot Operating System), MediaPipe, and a custom NER (Neural Entity Recognition) model to analyze posture and provide real-time feedback. By combining robotics and AI, this prototype helps reduce the risk of workplace injuries and promotes safe lifting practices. Although the concept can be applied broadly, this prototype was developed specifically for industrial and warehouse settings.
