This is my masters project I made an injury prevention robot that can be used in all sorts of environments, but for this project it was made for work placed that requires heavy lifting. This robot would help carry things from point a to b and then the worker would pick it up and put it on a pallet, shelf, or another place, this robot would look at posture of the person and the make sure they're lifting properly with proper technique
